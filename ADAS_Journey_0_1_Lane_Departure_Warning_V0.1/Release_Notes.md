# Release Notes ‚Äì v1.0

# Project: ADAS_Journey_0_1_Lane_Departure_Warning  
> Version: `v1.0`  
> Type: Initial Feature Release  
> Status: ‚úÖ Stable  
> Author: Abhiram Pavuluri

## Overview
This is the **first official release (v1.0)** of a self-driven ADAS development series focused on creating core driver assistance features using Python and OpenCV. In this version, I‚Äôve implemented a **Level 0 Lane Departure Warning (LDW)** system that detects lane starting positions and issues a visual drift warning. It's part of a larger journey to independently build ADAS features level-by-level, bridging the gap between testing and algorithm development.

## Features Introduced in v1.0

- Real-time video input capture using **MSS** (tested on GTA 5 window)
- Region of Interest (ROI) masking to isolate lane-relevant pixels
- Basic **perspective transformation** to simulate a bird‚Äôs-eye view
- Lane base point detection using **histogram analysis**
- Visual overlay warnings when lane drift is detected
- Adjustable HSV filters and ROI for dynamic tuning

---

## üîß Known Limitations

- Only detects **starting positions** of lane lines ‚Äî full tracking not yet implemented
- Sliding window technique is **incomplete**
- Drift detection based on simplified base point analysis; not curvature aware

## Roadmap: What‚Äôs Next?

### Planned for **v1.1**
- Complete the sliding window logic for better lane localization
- Smooth out left/right lane point detection with temporal memory

### Planned for **v2.0**
- Implement full lane detection using **polynomial fits**
- Add curvature estimation and vehicle position offset
- Introduce Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transforms as alternative strategies

## Final Thoughts
This is a foundational release meant to kickstart a structured, open-learning journey into ADAS engineering. As someone transitioning from testing to development, my goal is to make every line of code a step closer to mastering perception-based autonomy.

Your feedback, suggestions, or contributions are always welcome!
