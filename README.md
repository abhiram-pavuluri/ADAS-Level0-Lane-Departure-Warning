ADAS Level 0 - Lane Departure Warning System

This project is part of my self-driven journey into the world of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). With two years of industry experience as an ADAS tester, I often found myself distanced from the core algorithms. To bridge that gap, Iâ€™ve begun building ADAS features from the ground up using Python and OpenCVâ€”starting here with a **Level 0 Lane Departure Warning (LDW)** system.

 What is Lane Departure Warning (LDW)?
Lane Departure Warning is a basic yet critical ADAS feature that monitors lane markings and alerts the driver when the vehicle unintentionally drifts out of its lane.

What This Project Does
- Captures screen or video input
- Detects lane lines using image processing techniques (Canny edge detection, ROI masking, Hough Transform, etc.)
- Applies smoothing for stability using `deque`
- Identifies lane drift and triggers a warning

Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- MSS

Features Implemented
- âœ… Real-time video processing
- âœ… Lane detection with adjustable ROI
- âœ… Left/right lane smoothing with historical memory
- âœ… Visual warning overlay on drift detection


What's Next?
I will be progressing through ADAS levels and building each function incrementally:
1. Level 0 - LDW âœ…
2. Level 1 - Lane Keep Assist (LKA)
3. Level 1 - Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
4. Level 2+ - Sensor fusion, path planning, etc.

Stay tuned!
